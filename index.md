 The game goal is to protect are and characters from various threats ranging from zombies, monsters, and enemy soldiers and minions. That includes doing primary and secondary objectives through levels. The game will also have side quests and mini-games. The game has elements of modern RPG where each character will have different roles in the further game storyline for example policeman Eric is like a modern time Paladin from the Diablo series, he possesses strong will and discipline, and moral integrity of the group.  Computer hacker Agata is like a modern sorcerer with her knowledge in technology. Her knowledge will be used to disable control levels in certain areas open doors or get certain information from other servers or computers with hacking. Later she can hack on some computers to gain information about some secret projects but also to steal money but as the game progresses money will drastically lose value to your group and the matter of survival will be crucial.   Doctor Jacob is like a modern time healer. He can help other members of the party and help with medical treatment of other NPC’s and complete side quests by helping other people. Ying is like a blade master unit that relies on cold weapons and martial arts. Maybe mostly similar to the barbarian class in Diablo or Blade master from Warcraft 3 but very authentic. Her biggest advantage is her speed and she is shorter than the rest of the group so she can take some tasks which involve stealth and going through specific areas. All members of the group start separately their gameplay stories of how they got involved in the middle of virus infection and they got together in a party. In the first couple of levels, you play with every character solo gameplay, and later as the plot develops they got together in the safe zone. The safe zone is the local hospital where are their headquarters from where they go to different missions across the island. Some missions are very unusual for example first mission when you play with a policeman is to find the person which called for help but his car got hit by something unusual and broken down as he finds himself into a mutant infection danger zone where traveling circus has their tents. As he finds a way to escape the area his only option to escape quickly is to find the car Yugo which keys he has found as he knows the coordinates of the car. You have NPC’s through the game which are locals where you can buy stuff like weapons, health kits, or other things. Some NPC’s gave you side quests to complete which if you accomplish them gives you various bonuses. At the beginning of the game, you control one character at a time but later you can control more of them. We are open to making a multiplayer option but in the future. Defense of the HQ is one of the crucial objects of the game where you will need to organize defense by gaining all kinds of materials like barricades, automatic weapons, ballistic weapons, and people who could help you. Also helping injured people is very important because it gives various bonuses. Advancing to higher levels also gives you additional bonuses. Gameplay includes gathering all kinds of resources in order for your party to survive including people you are taking care of. Carrying materials depends on available spots in inventory.

The plot of the game is about survival on an Island and later in a city area after failed military experiments resulted in a large population turned into zombies or mutants.  Although it sounds very generic game has a very complex storyline filled with plot twists and character development inside of the storyline. The plot of the game is a mix of zombie apocalypse movies, conspiracy theories, science fiction packed with a lot of dark humor in order to make it as much authentic it can be among survival games that are very present in the present-day gaming scene.
